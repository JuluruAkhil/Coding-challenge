## Introduction
### About DBKudos
All employees strive to give their best and stand out from the rest. In that process, they deliver excellent results. However, all such work cannot be rewarded with a promotion, a bonus or an award. Sometimes, a little pat in the back is all it takes to uplift the moods of the employees. This is exactly what the DBKudos platform does. 

### The Problem
An employee may be applauded by several others, but there is little that they can do to show off their success to their peers. 
Along the similar lines, the major problems that were identified are -
* No proper tracking system to track the number of kudos received till date
* Lack of a marketplace where these kudos can be redeemed
* No public profile/leaderboard available to compare progress amongst peers 

### The Solution
To solve the above problems, we came up with our very own **DBKudosEmojis** platform. Our solution addresses all the above problems. Requirements gathering was mainly done based on the calls we had with the Product Owners. Several brainstorming activities later, we came up with the following phases -
|            Phases            	|                                                                               Description                                                                               	|
|:----------------------------:	|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:	|
| Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 	|                                                        The minimum working product having all the core features.                                                        	|
|     Good to have features    	|                 Some extra features which would enhance the experience of the users greatly.<br>These features will be developed once the MVP is ready.                 	|
|     Post coding challenge    	| These are several advanced features that would require access to the DB environment.<br>These features would be developed when this is actually taken up as a project.  	|

Next, we came up with the features and prioritized them in the following manner - 
|                                                                                                                                                                       MVP                                                                                                                                                                       	| Good to have features                                                                                                                                          	|                                                                  Post coding challenge                                                                  	|
